# E-Commerce-Website

This is a dummy e-commerce website that is used for testing purposes. It does not sell any real products, but it does provide a way to test the functionality of an e-commerce website.

Note:

In my website, I've added an image with the svg format which is very useful for the web developer.
If the image is in png,jpg,or anyother format, when we zoom the picture the image will break or has very poor quality but in svg format the image will not break and it's the best method for web developer.

I want to add some of the features that on my website, such as:

A variety of payment methods
A shipping calculator
A customer review system and so on....
